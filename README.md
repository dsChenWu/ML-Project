# ML-Project
## Hi ThereðŸ‘‹
In this reporsitory, it shows how I did the ML for different datasets and give some summary which ML model is better.
There are some topics I did:
1. Credit Card Approval
2. Predict Boston Housing
3. Titanic Survived
In these three topics, the aim is to build a predicted model and make the prediction accuracy rate as high as possible.
