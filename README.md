# ML-Project
### Hi There👋
In this reporsitory, it shows how I did the Machine-Learning for different datasets and give some summary which ML model is better. The aim is to build a predicted model and make the prediction accuracy rate as high as possible.
Covered by below topics:
#### 1. Credit Card Approval Classifier
   🔎 **Abstract :** Constructed a machine learning model to be a assistant to help the bank auto-classify the application.\
   📊 **Data Source:** [UCI University](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval) \
   🛠️ **Tool:**: *Python, Sciki-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*
#### 2. Boston House Predicting (StanCode AI Course Project)
   🔎 **Abstract :** Find the best model to predict the house price in Boston. It can be an example for different country to do the data-analysis to find the variables which have the impact on the price.\
   📊 **Data Source:** [From Kaggle](https://github.com/dsChenWu/ML-Project/tree/492b657036aea5d85bdc20a4a61d0a9f00637b12/Boston_housing/boston_housing_data) \
   🛠️ **Tool:**: *Python, Sciki-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*
#### 3. Titanic Survived (StanCode AI Course Project)
   🔎 **Abstract :** Constructed a classifier to analyze the reason which people will have higher survived chance and be a helpful program to get high accuracy of prediction of survival.\
   📊 **Data Source:** [From Kaggle](https://github.com/dsChenWu/ML-Project/tree/492b657036aea5d85bdc20a4a61d0a9f00637b12/Titanic_Survived/titanic_data) \
   🛠️ **Tool:**: *Python, Sciki-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*\
   ⭐️ **Notice:** The method of constructing machine learning model is including which **by hand-made without using package** or used Sciki-learn package.
#### 4. AI Review System (StanCode AI Course Project)
   🔎 **Abstract :** Constructed a machine learning model with hand-by-hand doing data-structer, calculating, gradient training, tuing hyperparameter....\
   🛠️ **Tool:**: *Python, Dictionary, List, Objective*
